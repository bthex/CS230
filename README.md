Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  
  Development of a web-based version of “Draw It or Lose It” for The Gaming Room. The client currently has the app available only on the Andriod app store.   The complete the full scope of this project Creative Technology Solutions will need to meet these requirements, providing a web-based environment and a     web-based version of “Draw It or Lose It”. The game had 4 key requirements as follows, the game will support one or more teams, each team will have         multiple players, team and player names will be unique, and only one instance will exist at any given time. 
  
 What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
 
  My most thorough and though out section was the evaluation section. I believe it has all the information required and make it easy to make                 reccomendations.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

   The most important part of the disgin document for me was the design constraints and design model. These two sections layed out what the software needed    and I could build it from there. I may have had to change a few things in the end but the bulk of what I was trying to accomlish came from those two        sections.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would revise my recommendations section. I made all the reccomendations that I think are best but I did not have enough information backing up my         desicions so it may be hard to understand why I made the decisions I did.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  If the user's needs are not taking into account then you could make it impossible for your user base to have access or be able to use your software. For   this project the user's needs were taken into account but since accessing the game only needs an internet browser it did not put restrictions on the       development.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  To help design the software I tried to make a detailed UML document to make sure I had all the requried inheritance and variables that needed to be         added. AFter that was complete I created one class at a time and finished it completely before moving on to the next one. This helped me make sure that I   did not miss anything.
